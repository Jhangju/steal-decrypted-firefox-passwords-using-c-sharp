# steal-decrypted-firefox-passwords-using-c-sharp
To crack the encrypted passwords we need DLLs and use them and by doing that there are a lot of files in the end. This project will help you to create a standalone executable which on double click save all password  in passes.txt.

The orginal project was https://github.com/jabiel/BrowserPass which then modified. And there are a lot of files which then be solved. At the end it was one exe who do all the task.
